## 🚀 Excited to share News365—my latest project, a comprehensive news application built with React Native! 📱📰

With News365, staying informed has never been easier. Here’s a quick look at the features that make this app stand out:

## 🔑 Key Features:
**Seamless Login with Firebase**: Integrated Firebase email/password authentication, so users can create accounts or log in with ease. If already logged in, users are redirected directly to the home screen upon reopening the app.
Trending News Carousel: Leveraged my custom-built NPM package, react-native-sg-basic-carousel, to display the latest trending news in a dynamic carousel, making it easy to keep up with the top stories.

**Curated News Recommendations**: Recommended articles are shown below the carousel with an option to “View All” that lets users explore news across different categories.
Bookmark & Share: Users can bookmark articles to revisit in the “Bookmarks” tab (built with Redux for smooth state management) or share articles instantly. A full article view opens in the browser for easy reading.

**Discover & Search**: With global search functionality, users can find news on any topic of interest from around the world.
User Profile: Displays user details to add a personalized touch.

Building News365 allowed me to combine React Native with Firebase, Redux, and my custom NPM package, creating a feature-rich, user-friendly news platform. Special thanks to everyone who helped along the way!

Looking forward to enhancing this further and would love your feedback! 🙌
